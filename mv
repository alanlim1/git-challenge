"mv" = rename / move files
        eg: ~/git-challenge/nonamefile
            mv nonamefile filewithname    (file name changes to "filewithname")
            
            ~/git-challenge/filewithname
            mv filewithname ~/Desktop     ("filewithname" file moves to Desktop)
            
            What is the command for renaming and moving in a single line of code? 
            mv command will autocreate new folders if moving to a new destination path.
